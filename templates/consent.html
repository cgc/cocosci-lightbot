            You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide to participate in this study, it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take the time to read the following information carefully. Please ask the researcher if there is anything that is not clear or if you need more information.
          </p>

          <h5>Purpose of the research:</h5>

          <p class="block-text">
            This study is designed to look at how people make decisions. In this task, you will be asked to make choices and answer questions related to those decisions.
          </p>

          <h5>Study Procedures</h5>

          <p class="block-text">
            The experiment consists of finding paths through a web of connected images. The task will not involve deception or emotionally disturbing materials.
            <!-- On each round of the experiment, you will be presented with two configurations of stacked blocks. Your task is to rearrange the blocks on the left to match the blocks on the right, which will always be in alphabetical order in the middle column. In some cases you may be asked to provide explanations or justifications for your responses. The task will not involve deception or emotionally disturbing materials - you will simply be asked to rearrange stacked blocks. -->
          </p>
          <p class="block-text">
            The answers you provide in the task may be used as stimuli for future participants. However, data that would identify you will not be shared with other participants.
          </p>

          <p class="block-text">
            Your total expected time commitment for this study is: <b>10 &ndash; 25 minutes.</b>
          </p>

          <h5>Benefits and Risks</h5>

          <p class="block-text">
            There are no direct benefits to you as a participant; however, by furthering our understanding of human cognition, this research will benefit society by helping with the development of automated systems that can better solve problems that are computationally challenging, but that people can solve easily with little formal guidance.
          </p>

          <p class="block-text">
            Risks associated with participation in this study are minimal. You may feel slight discomfort answering some questions, but you may refrain from answering any questions that make you uncomfortable and may withdraw your participation at any time even after completing the experiment without penalty.
          </p>

          <h5>Confidentiality</h5>

          <p class="block-text">
            We will not be asking for any personally identifying information, and we will handle responses as confidentially as possible. Your name, or your Worker IDs will never be tied to your responses on this survey. However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet. To minimize this risk, data containing anything that might be personally identifiable (e.g. Worker IDs) will be encrypted on transfer and storage and will only be accessible to qualified lab personnel. We will be keeping data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely. This anonymized data (containing neither Worker IDs nor IP addresses) may be shared with the scientific community.
          </p>

          <h5>Compensation</h5>

          <p class="block-text">
            For your participation, you will receive <b>$2.70</b>.
            If you are on Prolific and for any reason you do not complete the study (e.g. technical difficulties, or a desire to stop), we will only be able to pay you if you send a message through Prolific, or by emailing the researcher, Carlos Correa, at cgcorrea@princeton.edu.
            If you have any questions about the study, feel free to contact Carlos Correa or the Principal Investigator, Thomas Griffiths, at tomg@princeton.edu.
            <!-- as well as a performance-dependent bonus. The average bonus is <b>$0.75</b> -->
            <!--
            If you are on MTurk and for any reason you do not complete the study (e.g. technical difficulties, or a desire to stop), we will only be able to pay you if you send an email through MTurk, or by emailing the researcher, Fred Callaway, at fredcallaway@princeton.edu. If you have any questions about the study, feel free to contact Fred Callaway or the Principal Investigator, Thomas Griffiths, at tomg@princeton.edu.
